## Let's Encrypt

PDNS Manager allows you to easily use the service of the fully automated
CA [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) or any other ACME
compiliant CA by using the [dehydrated](https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated)
client in combination with the PDNS Manager API.

### Getting required components

The software depends on the following tools:

* jq
* curl
* openssl
* git

On Debian you can install those using:

```bash
sudo apt-get install openssl jq curl git
```

Afterwards, change into the directory you want the tools located at and
issue the following command:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/loewexy/pdns-acme
```

### Initializing the Software
Switch to the directory of pdns-acme and run:

```bash
./pdns-acme init
```

### Add domain to use
Issue:
```bash
./pdns-acme key
```
and copy the output to your clipboard.

In the next step, open a browser and login to your PDNS Manager
instance. Add a record to your domain with the name
**_acme-challenge.&lt;yourdomain&gt;**, type **TXT** and content **none**.
Use a Priority of 0 and a TTL of 60.

Afterwards, click on key icon, which is the last icon in the row of
the record. Click on *Key*. Enter a description like **ACME** and
paste the public key from your clipboard into the field. Confirm with
*Save*.

### Configure pdns-acme

Copy the example configuration:

```
cp pdns-acme.json.example pdns-acme.json
```

Open the file **pdns-acme.json** with an editor of your choice. In the
**config** section adjust the path of your PDNS Manager installation
and the deploy-wait value. The deploy-wait parameter determines
how long the script should wait for the DNS servers to get the right
results. This value depends on your nameserver setup. The default of
120 should do well for most setups. After these changes, the section looks
like the following:

```json
"config": {
        "server": "https://<yourdomain>/",
        "deploy-wait": 300
    }
```

### Add domain names to the config

In the section domains you must add an entry for every name you want
to have on any certificate. It is, as can be seen from the example, a
dictionary mapping domain names to the record ids of the matching
_acme-challenge. record.

### Configure certificates

In the section certs you can configure which certificates are generated.
It is a dictionary where the key is the primary ceritificate name, the value
is a dictionary, which can have two properties. "alias" stores an array of
strings with alternative domain names. "hook" can be a string or array of
strings, with commands executed if the certificate was changed. This can be
used e.g. to restart a webserver using the certificate.

### Run pdns-acme

Now you can issue
```bash
./pdns-acme cron
```
to start the process. If there are no errors you will have a directory
"certs" with your certificates.

### Automate renewal
For automatic renewal of your certificates, add an entry to **/etc/crontab** as
follows:

```txt
0 2     * * *   root    /root/pdns-acme/pdns-acme cron
```

### Advanced options

You can use other options, which dehydrated supports. Those can be looked
up in its [documentation](https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated). Config
options can be put in a file called "dehydrated.config" in the pdns-acme directory.
Its content will be appended to the config generated by pdns-acme.
